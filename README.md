To follow the logic of the codes, please follow the comments of ‘first_threshold_6000.py’. Other .py files have Chat GPT’s comments as comments yet.
  
The codes follow a specific pattern. ‘Xth_threshold_Y000_***’. First threshold is 28, 29 Celsius degree GDD, second threshold is 30 Celsius degree and so forth. 6000 means that the period of 1960 to 2000 is used and 8000 means that the period of 1980 to 2000 is used. When there is a term ‘absolute’ at the end of the code file name, absolute number differences of corn yield are compared and when there is no ‘absolute’ in the file name, percentage differences of corn yield are compared. The different codes that are based on the same time period and threshold use the same datasets in the same folder, so please do not change the file names of the datasets.
